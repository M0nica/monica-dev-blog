### Image Types: Pixel vs. Vector

Great! You are headed to Photoshop to start designing your dream logo \*pause\* your logo should be designed as a vector file. Basic shapes and text in Photoshop can easily be converted to paths (vectors) whereas more complex design elements will require you to manually create a path.

If you plan on designing anything digitally its important to understand the difference between TWO different image types: vectors and bitmaps/pixel-based images.

Bitmap (or pixel-based) images are complex and appear more photographic than vector images. Vector images store a lot less information than bitmap images and therefore are able to load faster.

### Vector Images

Vector images are objects created by mathematical calculations. You can scale vector images to any size and the image will preserve its integrity.

Uses: Logos, Cartoons/Illustrations, Icons

Tools: Adobe Illustrator

Example File Types: . EPSs, .AIs, .SVGs and .PDFs.

### Bitmap Images (a.k.a Raster images)

Bitmaps are pixel-based images. They are made up of thousands of itty-bitty pixels or dots. Each pixel can store a different color and the overall pattern of pixels will make up an image (think of each pixel as a piece of the puzzle that contribute to the overall image). If you try to enlarge a photograph you will see that it becomes blurry.

Uses: photos, printed design material

Tools: Adobe PhotoShop

Example File Types: . JPEGs, GIFs, .TIFs and .PNGs

## Attending various tech Meetups over the years has been pivotal to my growth as a technologist

I took a leap and left my full-time job as an email marketer, to work to pursue
software engineering! This summer I kicked off my engineering career as a Full
Stack Engineering Intern at [Meetup](https://medium.com/@meetup) with the
Meetups at [WeWork](https://medium.com/@WeWork) team; we are responsible for
allowing organizers to seamlessly book space to host their Meetup events. I
strongly encourage event organizers to check it out and learn more
[here](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004656412-What-is-Meetups-WeWork-)
as this service is currently free.

Attending various Meetups in New York City over the years has been pivotal to my
growth as a technologist and has led me to go to technical talks and conferences
that covered topics beyond my comfort zone, pushed me to contribute my writing
to multiple Medium publications, helped me to go from student to teaching
assistant to teacher and even served as a valuable resource during the technical
interview prep process.

I’d like to share some of the tech-related Meetups that I’ve benefitted the most
from in recent years that have helped me transition from marketing into
engineering.

#### 1. Women Who Code NYC

[Women Who Code](https://medium.com/@WomenWhoCode) (WWC) is “an international
non-profit organization that provides services for women pursuing technology
careers.”

* What I love about WWC? I really enjoy one of their signature Meetups which
revolves around solving whiteboarding problems. Whiteboarding algorithms
commonly comes up in technical interviews, and practicing with other people in a
supportive environment helps make them a little less intimidating and allows you
to exercise the skills that are needed to do well when solving coding challenges
during an interview.
* Algorithms! Meet monthly and go through various problems on a whiteboard in a
small group working in the same language.
* Pro-Tip — Go to their next Algorithms Meetup even if you don’t think you’re
“ready” yet! You can check out [Women Who Code
NYC](https://medium.com/@WomenWhoCodeNYC)’s GitHub
([https://github.com/WomenWhoCodeNYC/Algorithms](https://github.com/WomenWhoCodeNYC/Algorithms))
for a sneak peak of the type of problems they generally ask and sneak in some
practice.

#### **2**. Girl Develop It NYC

[Girl Develop It](https://medium.com/@girldevelopit) (GDI) is hands-down one of
my favorite tech non-profits (right up there with Black Girls Code). They
recently celebrated having over 100,000 members across the country.

* GDI hosts workshops for adults learning how to code with their [open-sourced
curriculum](https://www.girldevelopit.com/materials) that covers everything from
general web concepts to React, Pandas, Python, HTML/CSS and more. Their classes
are generally more affordable than similar offerings at for-profit entities.
* Pro-tip: Don’t let the cost deter you, as they offer scholarships for *every*
class. Every event they host with a cost associated has a link to apply for the
scholarship; individuals are eligible to be awarded up to 4 Girl Develop It NYC
scholarships in a year.
* What I love about GDI? They provide a supportive, judgement-free place for
individuals new to coding and those looking to teach what they know to others.
My local GDI’s leadership encouraged me to get out of my “comfort zone” and
serve as a teaching assistant which was a very rewarding experience and helped
me become more confident in my technical skills. Additionally, I’m a fan of Girl
Develop It NYC’s weekly newsletter (exclusive to their Meetup members) which
features interesting coding libraries and relevant opportunities.

#### 3. Write/Speak/Code NYC

[Write/Speak/Code](https://medium.com/@writespeakcode) (W/S/C) works “to
**increase the visibility and leadership of women and non-binary coders**
through thought leadership, conference speaking, open source contributions,
career development, personal growth and self-care.”

* W/S/C primarily hosts career development events that revolve around writing,
public speaking, open source contributions and other professional development
topics.
* Pro-tip: I was going to say grab a ticket to their upcoming 4 day conference but
it already sold out ;) So my tip would be to plan ahead and consider attending
their next conference!
* What I love about W/S/C? I strongly encourage anyone with even a hint of
imposter syndrome to look into W/S/C. I went to a one day event they hosted in
NYC last Fall, [Own Your
Expertise](https://github.com/WriteSpeakCode/wsc-resources/tree/master/own-your-expertise),
and was really challenged to examine how I view leaders in the workplace. I left
that event feeling empowered by knowing that with my current skillset and
knowledge I already have valuable expertise to share.

#### 4. Black Software Engineers NYC

* This group is run by We Build Black, which is a non-profit organization that
focuses on creating safe spaces for Black technologists and creating educational
programs.
* Pro-tip: They frequently host free workshops geared at those learning a new
programming language or technology (React Lifecycle, Python Programming, Intro
to JavaScript, etc.). You can sign up for an upcoming class at
[https://www.meetup.com/Black-Software-Engineers-of-NYC/](https://www.meetup.com/Black-Software-Engineers-of-NYC/).
* What I love about Black Software Engineers NYC: They have created a supportive
environment for individuals from various backgrounds and if you are just getting
started with programming you will be in great company! Of all of the Meetups
I’ve attended over the years I strongly believe this one is one of the most
community-oriented ones.

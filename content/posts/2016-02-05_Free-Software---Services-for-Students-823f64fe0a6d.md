### Free Software & Services for Students

I always enjoy finding a good deal! I sat down to compile a list of free resources related to technology for students. You can view my older posts that lists out free web development resources (for everyone) [here](https://medium.com/@monica_/free-web-development-resources-6501e30c776f#.3ikfgbun9).

Having an e-mail address that ends with ‘.edu’ comes with its perks. Please note that some of these offers require your institution to be enrolled in the program but others are open to all students and even instructors. Each website will tell you any specific requirements that you need to qualify to recieve the free product/service.
